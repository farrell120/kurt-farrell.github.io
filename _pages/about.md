# About Me

Dr. Farrellâ€™s research aims to understand modifiers of the tau protein in elderly individuals across both normal and pathological aging. He is currently investigating how machine learning approaches in digital pathology can be integrated with genetic and transcriptomic data to understand drivers of tau proteostasis.
